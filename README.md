# Code-Examples
This repository is intended to demonstrate my scientific simulations via example codes. What follows is a short description of the intent of each of the example codes provided.

The folder 'Pauli Dynamics' contains the python files 'PauliRepresentation.py' and 'PauliTimeEvolution.py', used to conduct time evolution of a transverse-field Ising model in the Pauli string representation using the python programming language. The scientific library 'numpy' was used for linear algebra, although most of the analytical work was carried out using custom string-based logic implemented as functions at the top of each file. Data analysis was carried out using the 'matplotlib' library for data visualization in a later python file (not included here).

The folder 'Matrix Product States Library' contains the custom MATLAB library that I have built for the matrix product states tensor network method. Originally built for simulation purposes in 2016, the library has been heavily updated to include matrix product operator and matrix product density operator simulation methods too. Additionally, the library includes the option for custom lattices, unlike off-the-shelf libraries that require identical degrees of freedom across the lattice sites.

The folder 'Generalized Quantum Regression Theorem' contains the MATLAB files 'fourTimeCorrelationNoise.m' and 'calculateCorrelation.m'. The former 'fourTimeCorrelationNoise.m' generalizes the so-called quantum regression theorem to arbitrary correlation functions, including out-of-time-ordered, while the latter file 'calculateCorrelation.m' applies the generalized quantum regression theorem to a particular quantum optics problem.
