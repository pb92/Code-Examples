# Code-Examples
This repository is intended to demonstrate my scientific simulations via example codes. What follows is a short description of the intent of each of the example codes provided.

The folder 'Pauli Dynamics' contains the python files 'PauliRepresentation.py' and 'PauliTimeEvolution.py', used to conduct time evolution of a transverse-field Ising model in the Pauli string representation using the python programming language. The scientific library 'numpy' was used for linear algebra, although most of the analytical work was carried out using custom string-based logic implemented as functions at the top of each file. Data analysis was carried out using the 'matplotlib' library for data visualization in a later python file (not included here).
